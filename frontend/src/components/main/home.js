                   Our vision is to make every parking transaction a sub-conscious experience. With a strong foundation of the team, technology, and partnerships, we are creating a future-proof parking platform to connect the parking industry internally as well as with urban mobility players.

                  Our technology enables seamless use of parking for pick up and drop of shared mobility, storage and deliveries for e-commerce, EV charging, and on the fly automotive services.

                  Traditional parking equipment operates in silos and at best might work together with other products from the same manufacturer. In todayâ€™s new-age mobility, you need an ecosystem of integrated hardware and software components regardless of which version or vendor they all come from. Our GMP Platform delivers you that coherent interoperable ecosystem.
